LIDA Framework v1.1b Changelog- In general this version provides several improvements that ease the declaration and intialization of an Agent.- 'AgentAction' is now 'Action', which improves upon the previous implementation.- Improved how AttentionCodelet and StructureBuildingCodelet Modules create codelets with attributes specified by the task type definition given in the factoryData.xml. - NeighborhoodAttentionCodelet has been added.- BasicAttentionCodelet now provides initialization for nodes in its sought content.- Several abstract methods in FrameworkModuleImpl now have empty implementations and may or may not be overriden by a subclass. GuiPanels- Improvements to GlobalWorkspaceTable and Logging panel.   - Added ActivationChart, ProceduralMemory, and ActionSelection panels. Agent XML declaration file- Global parameters available to all Initializers (via a new GlobalInitializer) at startup can now be declared at the beginning of the file.  - Initial tasks must now specify their task type which is defined in the factoryData.xml file. -  Such task declarations may define parameters overriding those given by the factoryData defintion. - Can no longer define codelets in factoryData.xml; rather FrameworkTasks (including codelets) can now be defined. - GlobalInitializer is now available to share parameters across Initializers. - Improvements to several toString methods - RefractoryPeriod interface has been added.  AttentionCodelets and the GlobalWorkspace now implement it. - TaskManager now manages the refreshing of the GUI including GuiPanels. Refresh rate is a new parameter of unit tick. - Basic Pam, ProceduralMemory, SensoryMotorMemory Initializers have been added. - Improvements to activation passing in PAM. - BasicDetectionAlgorithm now provides initialization for the node it detects.
