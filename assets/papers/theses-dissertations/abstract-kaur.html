    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIDA is an integrated, comprehensive control architecture for autonomous agents capable of making complex decisions in dynamic environments. LIDA's computational architecture consists of various modules that each operate asynchronously. However, the Global Workspace (GW) module, responsible for conscious attention, transfers information serially. There can be several computational techniques used to initiate the broadcast of content from the GW. The present study evaluated four techniques called "triggers" to start the GW broadcast under four different conditions. A parameter search was performed to find the optimum trigger parameters, followed by an investigation to identify the trigger(s) which were most useful for an efficient autonomous agent operating in an ALife domain. The Individual Activation Above Threshold (IAAT) trigger performed the best among all four triggers when used individually, whereas, the IAAT and No Broadcast Occurring (NBO) trigger combination outperformed all the other triggers individually, or in combination.</td>
