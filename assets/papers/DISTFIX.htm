<B><P>I.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  For many years the U.S. Navy personnel distribution process has relied on what is routinely referred to as the "Triad of Detailing" in an effort to ensure that the right person goes to the right billet (requirement) on time and with the proper training.  This triad of detailing consists of three distinct functions under the titles of Allocation, Placement and Assignment (or more specifically, detailing).  While each performs a specific function, elements of each directly influence the performance or outcome of the others.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  Functionally, this Triad of Detailing applies equally to both officer and enlisted personnel distribution.  On closer scrutiny, one finds subtle programmatic differences which tend to translate into a few significant process variances.  Most notable are the differences between officer and enlistment placement and the tendency of officer detailers to "batch" detail.  Officer distribution is considerably more "hands on", due in large part to nothing more than community size (60,100 officer versus 376,000 enlisted).  In officer placement, routine interaction occurs between an activity and BUPERS to ensure that officer vacancies are filled on time and with the best "qualified" officers.  Enlisted placement on the other hand relies heavily on "system" generated vacancy listings and placement is normally only involved when unexpected personnel losses occur. Recent chief petty officer placement initiative is very similar to officer placement.  Officer detailers and enlisted detailers perform essentially the same tasks in the day to day assignment process.  Officer detailers however tend to look at several officer candidates and numerous vacancies and attempt to make a "best match" for all officers and vacancies while the enlisted detailers tend to follow a more "sequential" method of making assignments, essentially, first come, first served. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  The purpose of allocation is to equitably spread available personnel to existing requirements.  Officers allocation is also used to develop the Navy Manning Plan - Officer, which is basically an established manning level for each activity.  For example, all ships, submarines and aircraft squadrons have a target manning of 100%; meaning that all billets will be filled with the appropriate designator and grade of officer called by the requirement.  Thus the NMP-O for these activities is 100%.  The remaining inventory is then evenly apportioned over the remaining activities, each category being given a target manning percentage through NMP-O.  Enlisted allocation attempts to evenly spread available personnel between sea and shore duty and between the four Manning Control Authorities (MCAs).  Enlisted allocation does not dictate manning level percentages.  The Officer Distributable Projections System (ODPROJ) and Enlisted Distributable Projections System (EDPROJ) are the principal tools used in the allocation process.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  Placement monitors the manning of the various activities.  In so doing, placement officers are considered the activity's advocates.  The most distinct difference between officer and enlisted placement was discussed above.  The responsibility here for both, is clearly on ensuring the activities are manned with the right individual, on time and with the correct training.  For officers billet information from the Total Force Manpower Management System (TFMMS) and personnel information from the Officer Assignment Information System (OAIS) are used extensively in conducting the placement function.  For enlisted placement the Active Readiness Information System as well as the Enlisted Assignment Information System (EAIS) are the principal information systems used.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  The assignment leg of the triad is most frequently referred to as detailing.  The detailers, whether officer or enlisted, are generally considered the member's advocate.  Especially in the case of officer detailing, the assignment officer typically strives to ensure his constituent is assigned to billets of ever increasing responsibility, whether at sea or ashore.  This is also true in enlisted detailing when the member reaches the more senior paygrades, typically first class petty officer (E-6) and above.  The actual mechanics of detailing are virtually the same with the method of vacancy listing construction being the most noticeable difference.  OAIS and EAIS are the principle information systems used for officers and enlisted respectively.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  The personnel distribution process for both officer and enlisted has been essentially unchanged for over twenty years.  Some changes are beginning to occur with the implementation of job advertising {Job Advertising and Selection System  (JASS)} in a large segment of the enlisted community and recent introduction into officer assignments </P>

<B><LI>Principal Functional Area - Distribution</LI></OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><P>  In general, distribution is the process whereby personnel managers direct the movement of individuals to fill vacancies in field activities. Distribution is better known as matching faces with spaces.  It includes three distinct processes including allocation, placement and assignment.   Allocation is the process whereby personnel expected to be available for assignment within a specified window of time are projected into specific areas {Atlantic Fleet, Pacific Fleet, BUPERS, or Reserve-Manning Control Authorities (MCAs)} and to either sea duty or shore duty, the latter based on eligibility.  Placement is concerned with the on time and appropriate, correct rating and paygrade or other qualifiers, assignment of personnel to sea and shore requirements by activity.  Assignment is primarily concerned with matching a particular individual with a particular job based on the needs of the Navy and the needs of the individual.  Enlisted distribution is quite different from officer distribution, even though they share primary functions, allocation, placement and assignment, and the same ultimate goal, have the right person in the right place with the proper training and on time.</P>

<P>            <B>(b)  Input</P>
</B><P>                    Enlisted Distributable Projection System (EDPROJ) </P>
<P>                    EDPROJ measures both onboard and projected manning percentages by paygrade and community.  </P>
<P>                    EDPROJ on-line tables exist, managed by Pers 452, to manually adjust continuation rates, sea/shore rotation information, etc.</P>
<P>                    </P>
<P>            <B>(c)  Process performed</P>
</B><P>                    EDPROJ runs monthly, requiring approximately 12 hours of mainframe operating time.  It measures those personnel by paygrade and community who are currently attached to an activity.  This provides a "current on board" personnel count.  It also measures those personnel projected (expected) to be attached to an activity 9 months in the future, Projected Onboard (POB) -9 and beyond.  Included in this measure are those personnel under orders to report to the activity between now and POB-9.  This calculation provides a POB-9 personnel count.  These results are termed  distributable strength.  The current and POB-9 distributable strength data is compared to current and P-9 projected billet data for the same paygrade/community to determine current manning percentage and projected manning percentage at P-9.  </P>
<P>                    </P>
<P>                    Personnel not already under orders are categorized by EDPROJ as "Determined" or "Undetermined" avails.  Determined avails are projected to either sea or shore duty based on an embedded algorithm in EDPROJ and the member's eligibility.  Undetermined avails are divided equally (or as determined by the EDPROJ manager through adjustable tables) between sea and shore.  Once this step is accomplished, the strength to fill CNO priority manning requirements is deducted from the total sea or shore strength.  The remaining distributable strength is then allocated.</P>
<P>                    </P>
<P>                    EDPROJ compares manning percentages between the four Manning Control Authorities (MCAs) and then allocates available disributable strength to each MCA in an attempt to "level" the      P-9 manning percentages.  This is done for sea and shore independently.</P>
<P>                    </P>

</B><P>                    The Allocation Tracking Module (ATM) provides on-line and real time allocation measures for the detailer.  ATM not only shows what the current allocation levels are but allows the detailer the ability to "what if" certain assignment actions.  It does not provide historical MOEs. </P>

<P>                    Pers 452 maintains hard copy measures by sea/shore, community and paygrade groupings of EDPROJ POB-9 projections and actual onboard when POB-9 becomes current.  This MOE is an Excel based, PC tool, manually run on a monthly basis.  </P>
<P>                    </P>
<P>            <B>(i)  Strengths and Weaknesses</P>
</B><P>                    EDPROJ is the only distributable strength projection system using current billet and personnel information.  It has on-line table adjustment capabilities that enable a knowledgeable manager to make adjustments to achieve more accurate projections.  Accuracy is acceptable - within 4-5%.  If allocation guidance, from ATM, is followed, equitable spread of available inventory will result.  On-line information is excellent.</P>
<P>                    </P>
<P>                    Does not do a good job of projecting short-lead time inventory changes, i.e. short accession pipelines.  EDPROJ would have to identify inventory before actually enlisted in some cases to more accurately reflect this situation.  It manages today based on a relatively steady state throughput of accessions through these shorter pipelines.  In cases where significant shortfalls (or overages) occur, EDPROJ tends to lag the change.</P>
<P>                    Mainframe based.  Slow process.  Few truly knowledgeable people on the process/system.  Out dated programming language.</P>

</B><P>                    The existing assignment process has been in effect for over twenty years and most Sailors are comfortable with the process.  There is a significant amount of personal interaction between the detailer and the constituent.  Perceptions are somewhat split - "I have talked to the detailer and we have worked out an assignment"; or, "I can't get anything from the detailer, I think he's hiding billets from me".</P>
<P>                    </P>
<P>                    Considerable amount of manual effort to perform this process.  Some improvements over time regarding automation of the process, however, the process is basically unchanged.  Each assignment is done in isolation of other assignments, call this a sequential assignment process.  The first person on a list of PRD rollers is assigned to one of the vacancies on a list.  Then the next person and so on.  Little attention is paid to "best match" opportunities.  No support tool/system to help assignment authority "batch" assignments.</P>

</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>     Unlike enlisted, officer distribution is done almost exclusively by one organization.  Allocation, placement and assignment are all managed within different divisions of  BUPERS.  The principles behind each of these processes are similar to those on the enlisted side, but there are subtle differences in the actual execution.  While some databases are shared, different systems are used to perform the functions.</P>

</B><P>                    Monthly mainframe execution or on demand.  Projected inventory information is compared to projected requirements.  This information is used to establish manning levels (by percentage - NMP-O) by activity types.</P>

<P>                    NMP-O uses data from ODPROJ (billet and bodies).</P>

</B><P>                    ODPROJ runs monthly, requiring approximately 2 hours of mainframe operating time.  It measures the officers onboard through the next twelve months by grade and designator.  Planned accessions are factored in and expected continuation is considered as well to produce an inventory projection.  It also measures the authorized billets through the next year.</P>
<P>                    NMP-O - runs monthly in conjunction with EDPROJ, PC based.  NMP-O uses the inventory to billet ratios to arrive at projected manning levels by types of activities.  Generally, warfighting forces have a manning level of 100%.  Where overall inventory shortages exist, these shortages are reflected in support activities, i.e. shore stations, air stations, etc.  Normally adjusted annually.</P>

</B><P>                    Assignment authority (detailer) determines that an individual requires assignment from one location to another.  Under normal circumstances this is caused by the member reaching projected rotation date (PRD).  At other times the member is "made available" for assignment, at other than PRD, as a result of completing training, hospitalization, etc.  Much of the officer assignment process is governed by adherence to "career flow points" - meaning that an officer should fill certain types of jobs at certain points in his/her career (department head/executive officer/commanding officer, etc.).</P>

Assignments based on PRD normally take longer due to the negotiation process, while assignments based on availability generally take less time (i.e. a large number of students graduating at the same time from a course of instruction).

Officer detailers tend to "slate" assignments, meaning that they look at a group of vacancies and a group of candidate officers and attempt to make the "best match" for several officers at once.  This is a notable difference from enlisted assignments.  The smaller number of officers, resulting in a smaller constituent to detailer ratio, allows this "batch detailing".  No automated tool exists to assist for this process.</P>

<P>  A.   What is the impact on distribution when a decision is made to immediately recommission a decommissioned platform (or several)?  If done in the short term, overall fleet manning must be reduced in order to cover the "new" requirements.  How much of an impact is there on fleetwide readiness?  What is the additional PCS funding impact?  What recommission timeline is supportable?  How many people would have to be moved early from sea duty to meet these requirements so as not to impact overall sea manning and readiness?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  B.   Four aircraft carriers will be decommissioned in a single fiscal year.  What is the impact on PCS funding?  What is the impact on endstrength constraints?  How much sea time should be waived for crew members in order to assign them ashore?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  C.   Following PCS household goods shipping adjustments during the fiscal year, the PCS manager must recover $20M to cover the increased costs.  What is the impact on individual detailers?  How many planned moves cannot be made?  How many moves must be canceled to recover the detailer's "fair share" of the bogey?</P>
