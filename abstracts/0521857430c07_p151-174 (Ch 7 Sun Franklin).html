    <td>This chapter aims to provide an overview of existing computational (mechanistic) 
      models of cognition in relation to the study of consciousness, on the basis 
      of psychological and philosophical theories and data. It examines various 
      mechanistic explanations of consciousness in existing computational cognitive 
      models. Serving as an example for the discussions, a computational model 
      of the conscious/unconscious interaction, utilizing the representational 
      difference explanation of consciousness, is described briefly. As a further 
      example, a software agent model that captures another explanation of consciousness 
      (the access explanation of consciousness) is also described. The discussions 
      serve to highlight various possibilities in developing computational models 
      of consciousness and in providing computational explanations of conscious 
      and unconscious cognitive processes.</td>
