    <td>In this paper, we present LIDA, a working model of, and theoretical foundation 
      for, machine consciousness. LIDA&#8217;s architecture and mechanisms were 
      inspired by a variety of computational paradigms and LIDA implements the 
      Global Workspace Theory of consciousness. The LIDA architecture&#8217;s 
      cognitive modules include perceptual associative memory, episodic memory, 
      functional consciousness, procedural memory and action-selection. Cognitive 
      robots and software agents controlled by the LIDA architecture will be capable 
      of multiple learning mechanisms. With artificial feelings and emotions as 
      primary motivators and learning facilitators, such systems will &#8216;live&#8217; 
      through a developmental period during which they will learn in multiple, 
      human-like ways to act effectively in their environments. We also provide 
      a comparison of the LIDA model with other models of consciousness .</td>
