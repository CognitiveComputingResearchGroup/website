    <td>In this position paper we attempt to derive an architecture  and mechanism for perceptual memory and learning for software agents and robots  from what is known, or believed, about the same faculties in human and other  animal cognition. Based on that of the IDA model of Global Workspace Theory, a  conceptual and computational model of cognition, this architecture, together  with its mechanisms, offers the real possibility of&nbsp; autonomous software agents and robots  learning their own ontologies during a developmental period. Thus the onerous  chore of designing and implementing such an ontology can be avoided.</td>
