    <td>This paper describes the &quot;conscious&quot;   learning mechanism of an adaptive software agent, Conscious Mattie (CMattie).   This conscious software agent takes the role of a departmental seminar   organizer. The agent gathers seminar information via email from humans, composes   an announcement of the next week's seminars, and mails it to members of a   mailing list which she maintains. Through further interaction with seminar   organizers, CMattie learns to handle new variations of seminars, such as   colloquia.&nbsp; In this paper, the agent's perception and consciousness modules   are described. Using a limited capacity global workspace that coordinates with   the perception module, CMattie communicates with human seminar organizers.   Through such interaction, CMattie gathers missing information and learns new   concepts for use in composing the announcements.</td>
