    <td>&ldquo;And as soon as I had recognized the taste of the piece of madeleine soaked in her decoction of
      lime-blossom which my aunt used to give me ... immediately the old grey house upon the street,
      where her room was, rose up like a stage set to attach itself to the little pavilion opening on to the
      garden which had been built out behind it for my parents ...; and with the house the town, from
      morning to night and in all weathers, the Square where I used to be sent before lunch, the streets
      along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took when it was fine ...&rdquo;<br />
      ---Marcel Proust, Remembrance of Times Past ()<br />
      <br />
      In these words the novelist Marcel Proust described a flood of unbidden memories evoked by the taste of what must be the most famous cookie in the world, Proust&rsquo;s madeleine soaked in limeblossom tea. It is of course an experience of spontaneous recall. Judging by numerous thoughtmonitoring studies, spontaneous recall is the norm in everyday thought. But because it is more difficult to study experimentally than deliberate recall, we know much less about it. In this chapter we describe how a current theory of conscious cognition, global workspace theory, leads naturally to a model of both deliberate and spontaneous recall. Deliberate recall is intended; spontaneous memories are not. They can be divided into two categories: <br />
      <br />
    1. acceptable spontaneous recall (ASR), like Proust&rsquo;s famous rush of memories evoked by the taste of the madeleine. Such memories are interesting or pleasant or at least tolerable; <br />
    <br />
    2. unwanted spontaneous recall (USR), such as painful traumatic events, an annoying recurrent melody, or a the memory of an unresolved argument with a loved one. <br />
