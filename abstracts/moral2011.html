    <td>Abstract: What roles or functions does consciousness fulfill in the making of moral decisions? Will artificial
agents capable of making appropriate decisions in morally charged situations require machine
consciousness? Should the capacity to make moral decisions be considered an attribute essential
for being designated a fully conscious agent? Research on the prospects for developing machines
capable of making moral decisions and research on machine consciousness have developed as
independent fields of inquiry. Yet there is significant overlap. Both fields are likely to progress
through the instantiation of systems with artificial general intelligence (AGI). Certainly special
classes of moral decision-making will require attributes of consciousness such as being able to
empathize with the pain and suffering of others. But in this article we will propose that consciousness
also plays a functional role in making most if not all moral decisions. Work by the
authors of this article with LIDA, a computational and conceptual model of human cognition,
will help illustrate how consciousness can be understood to serve a very broad role in the making
of all decisions including moral decisions.</td>
