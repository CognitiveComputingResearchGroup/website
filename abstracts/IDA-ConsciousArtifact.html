    <td>      After discussing various types of consciousness, several approaches to machine consciousness, software agent, and global 
      workspace theory, we describe a software agent, IDA, that is &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; in the sense of implementing that theory of 
      consciousness. IDA perceives, remembers, deliberates, negotiates, and selects actions, sometimes &ldquo;consciously.&rdquo; She uses a 
      variety of mechanisms, each of which is briefly described. It&rsquo;s tempting to think of her as a conscious artifact. Is such a view 
    in any way justified? The remainder of the paper considers this question.</td>
