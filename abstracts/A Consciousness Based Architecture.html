    <td>Here we describe an architecture  designed to accommodatemultiple aspects of human mental functioning. In a  roughly star-shaped configuration centered on a &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; module, the  architecture accommodates perception, associative memory, emotions,  action-selection, deliberation, language generation, behavioral and perceptual  learning, self-preservation and metacognition modules. The various modules  (partially) implement several different theories of these various aspects of  cognition. The mechanisms used in implementing the several modules have been  inspired by a number of different &ldquo;new AI&rdquo; techniques. One software agent  embodying much of the architecture is in the debugging stage (Bogner et al. in  press). A second, intending to include all of the modules of the architecture  is well along in the design stage (Franklin et al. 1998). The architecture,  together with the underlying mechanisms, comprises a fairly comprehensive model  of cognition (Franklin &amp; Graesser 1999). The most significant gap is the  lack of such human-like senses as vision and hearing, and the lack of  real-world physical motor output. The agents interact with their environments  mostly through email in natural language.<br />
      The &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; module is  based on global workspace theory (Baars 1988, 1997). The central role of this  module is due to its ability to select relevant resources with which to deal  with incoming perceptions and with current internal states. Its underlying  mechanism was inspired by pandemonium theory (Jackson 1987).<br />
      The  perception module employs analysis of surface features for natural language  understanding (Allen 1995).&nbsp; It partially  implements perceptual symbol system theory (Barsalou 1999), while its  underlying mechanism constitutes a portion of the copycat architecture  (Hofstadter &amp; Mitchell 1994). <br />
Within  this architecture the emotions play something of the role of the temperature in  the copycat architecture and of the gain control in pandemonium theory. They  give quick indication of how well things are going, and influence both  action-selection and memory. The theory behind this module was influenced by  several sources (Picard 1997, Johnson 1999, Rolls 1999). The implementation is  via pandemonium theory enhanced with an activation-passing network.<br />
The  action-selection mechanism of this architecture is implemented by a major  enhancement of the behavior net (Maes 1989).&nbsp;  Behavior in this model corresponding to goal contexts in global  workspace theory. The net is fed at one end by environmental and/or internal state  influences, and at the other by fundamental drives. Activation passes in both  directions. The behaviors compete for execution, that is, to become the  dominant goal context. <br />
The  deliberation and language generation modules are implemented via pandemonium  theory. The construction of scenarios and of outgoing messages are both  accomplished by repeated appeal to the &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; mechanism. Relevant  events for the scenarios and paragraphs for the messages offer themselves in  response to &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; broadcasts. The learning modules employ case-based  reasoning (Kolodner 1993) using information gleaned from human correspondents.  Metacognition is based on fuzzy classifier systems (Valenzuela-Rendon 1991).<br />
As  in the copycat architecture, almost all of the actions taken by the agents,  both internal and external, are performed by codelets. These are small pieces  of code typically doing one small job with little communication between them.  Our architecture can be thought of as a multi-agent system overlaid with a few,  more abstract mechanisms. Altogether, it offers one possible architecture for a  relatively fully functioning mind. One could consider these agents as early  attempts at the exploration of design space and niche space (Sloman 1998). </td>
