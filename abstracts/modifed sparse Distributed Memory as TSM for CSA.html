    <td>This paper presents a Modified Sparse Distributed Memory architecture for use in software agents with natural language processing capabilities. We have modified Kanerva&rsquo;s Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) into an architecture with a ternary memory space. This enables the memory to be used in IDA, the Intelligent Distribution Agent built for the U.S. Navy. IDA implements Baars&rsquo; global workspace theory, a psychological theory of consciousness. As a result, it can react to novel and problematic situations in a more flexible, more human-like way than traditional AI systems. IDA performs a function, namely billet assignment, heretofore reserved for humans. We argue that such flexibility requires advanced memory systems such as transient episodic memory and auto-biographical memory. Here, we present the architecture, tests and results of this modified SDM system which can be used as a transient episodic memory in suitable software agents.</td>
