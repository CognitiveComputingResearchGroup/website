    <td>This paper describes the  architecture of a &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; software agent, Conscious Mattie, who is socially  situated. We&rsquo;ll focus on consciousness and conceptual learning.&nbsp; CMattie gathers seminar information via email  from humans, composes an announcement of the next week&rsquo;s seminars, and mails it  to members of a mailing list that she maintains. Through further interaction  with seminar organizers, CMattie learns new variations to seminars, such as a  colloquium, that must also be announced, but is to be handled differently.&nbsp; In this paper, we discuss in detail the  functionality of CMattie&rsquo;s perception and consciousness modules that bring  about socially situated intelligence.&nbsp;  Using a limited capacity global workspace that coordinates with the perception  module, CMattie communicates with human seminar organizers.&nbsp; Through such interaction CMattie gathers  missing information and learns new concepts for use in composing the  announcements. Here a &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; software architecture and its mechanisms are  proposed as a method for designing and implementing useful, socially situated,  software agents.</td>
