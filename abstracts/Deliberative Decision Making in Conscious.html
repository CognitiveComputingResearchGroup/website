    <td>When we humans are faced with a problem to solve, we  often create in our mind different strategies or possible solutions. We imagine  the effects of executing each strategy or trial solution without actually doing  so. It's a kind of internal virtual reality. Eventually, we decide upon one strategy  or trial solution and try solving the problem using it. This whole process is  called deliberation. During the deliberation process several, possibly  conflicting, ideas compete to be selected as the strategy or solution of the  problem. One such is chosen voluntarily. In 1890 William James proposed a model  that describes this voluntary decision-making calling it the ideo-motor theory.  In this theory the mind is considered to be the seat of many ideas related to  each other either favorably or antagonistically. Whenever an idea prompts an  action by becoming conscious, antagonistic ideas may object to it, also by  becoming conscious, and try to block that action. Or, other favorable ideas may  become conscious to support it, trying to push its selection. While this  conflict is going on among several ideas we are said to be  &quot;deliberating&quot;. Software agents, so equipped, should be able to make  voluntary decisions much as we humans do. This paper describes a computational  mechanism for this deliberation process, including James' ideo-motor theory of  voluntary action. It also describes an implementation of the mechanism in a  software agent. Some preliminary experimentation is also reported.</td>
