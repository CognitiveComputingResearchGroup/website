    <td>Active components of classical working memory are 
      conscious, but traditional theory does not account for 
      this fact. Global Workspace theory suggests that consciousness 
      is needed to recruit unconscious specialized 
      networks that carry out detailed working memory functions. 
      The IDA model provides a fine-grained analysis 
      of this process, specifically of two classical workingmemory 
      tasks, verbal rehearsal and the utilization of a 
      visual image. In the process, new light is shed on the 
      interactions between conscious and unconscious<br />
    aspects of working memory. </td>
