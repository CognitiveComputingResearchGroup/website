    <td>We propose the use of autonomous  software agents as cognitive models that generate testable hypotheses about  human cognition. While such agents are typically produced to automate practical  human tasks, they can be designed within the constraints of a psychological  theory. As an example we describe an agent designed within global workspace  theory that accommodates several other theories as well. We discuss various  resulting hypotheses, including a new interpretation of the readiness potential  data of Libet. </td>
