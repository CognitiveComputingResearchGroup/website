    <td>Some animals may behave as if they are aware of their surroundings, and 
      respond to social stimuli, perhaps their own scents, to which they are exposed 
      sequentially or simultaneously. Such abilities would suggest that they may 
      have the capacity for self-recognition and self referencing. To test this 
      hypothesis, we exposed meadow voles to their own scent marks, those of unfamiliar 
      conspecifics and those of siblings, and used a habituation/dishabituation 
      task to determine if voles can distinguish among the scent marks of these 
      different donors. Voles discriminated their own scent marks from scent marks 
      of unfamiliar conspecifics and those of closely related individuals with 
      whom they share aspects of their phenotype. Gonadectomized voles that received 
      no replacement hormone also discriminated between scent marks of their current 
      selves and those of unfamiliar, similarly aged, same-sex conspecifics, and 
      distinguished between the scent marks of their past selves and those of 
      their current selves. In contrast, gonadectomized voles that received gonadal 
      hormone replacement behaved as if the scent marks of their past and current 
      selves were the same. The data are consistent with the suggestion that voles 
      may have the capacity for self referencing and self-recognition. Voles may 
      have a template for self and this template or its perception is affected 
      by circulating gonadal hormone titers. The implications of such a template 
      are discussed.</td>
