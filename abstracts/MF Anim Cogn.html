    <td>Some non-human animals may possess the ability to recall the &#8220;what&#8221;, 
      &#8220;where&#8221;, and &#8220;when&#8221; of a single past event. We tested 
      the hypothesis that male meadow voles posses the capacity to recall the 
      &#8220;what&#8221;, &#8220;where&#8221;, and &#8220;when&#8221; of a single 
      past event associated with mate selection<br />
      in two experiments. BrieXy, male voles were allowed to explore an apparatus 
      that contained two chambers. One chamber contained a day-20 pregnant female 
      (24 h prepartum). The other chamber contained a sexually mature female that 
      was neither pregnant nor lactating (REF<br />
      female). Twenty-four hour after the exposure, the males were placed in the 
      same apparatus, which was empty and clean. At this time, the pregnant female 
      would have entered postpartum estrus (PPE), a period of heightened sexual 
      receptivity. Males initially chose and spent significantly more time investigating 
      the chamber that originally housed the pregnant female (now a PPE female) 
      than the chamber that originally housed the REF female. Male voles also 
      explored an apparatus containing a chamber with a PPE female and one chamber 
      containing a REF female. Twentyfour hour later, males were placed into an 
      empty and clean apparatus. The males did not display an initial choice and<br />
      they spent similar amounts of time investigating the chamber that originally 
      housed the PPE female (now a lactating female) and the chamber that originally 
      housed the REF female. The results of these and additional experiments suggest 
      that male voles may have the capacity to recall the &#8220;what&#8221;, 
      &#8220;where&#8221;, and &#8220;when&#8221; of a single past event, which 
      may allow males to remember the location of females who would currently 
      be in heightened states of sexual receptivity.</td>
