    <td>Finding suitable jobs for US Navy sailors periodically  is an important and ever-changing process. An Intelligent Distribution Agent  (IDA) and particularly its constraint satisfaction module take up the challenge  to automate the process. The constraint satisfaction module's main task is to  provide the bulk of the decision making process in assigning sailors to new  jobs in order to maximize Navy and sailor &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;. We propose Multilayer Perceptron  neural network with structural learning in combination with statistical  criteria to aid IDA's constraint satisfaction, which is also capable of  learning high quality decision making over time. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)  with different structures and algorithms, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)  with logistic regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis  Function (RBF) as network structure and Adatron learning algorithm are  presented for comparative analysis. Discussion of Operations Research and  standard optimization techniques is also provided. The subjective indeterminate  nature of the detailer decisions make the optimization problem nonstandard. Multilayer  Perceptron neural network with structural learning and Support Vector Machine  produced highly accurate classification and encouraging prediction.</td>
