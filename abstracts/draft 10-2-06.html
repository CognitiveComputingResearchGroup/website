    <td>Implementing and fleshing out a number of psychological and neuroscience 
      theories of cognition, the LIDA conceptual model aims at being a cognitive 
      &#8220;theory of everything.&#8221; With modules or processes for perception, 
      working memory, episodic memories, &#8220;consciousness,&#8221; procedural 
      memory, action selection, perceptual learning, episodic learning, deliberation, 
      volition, and non-routine problem solving, the LIDA model is ideally suited 
      to provide a working ontology that would allow for the discussion, design, 
      and comparison of AGI systems. The LIDA architecture is based on the LIDA 
      cognitive cycle, a sort of &#8220;cognitive atom.&#8221; The more elementary 
      cognitive modules and processes play a role in each cognitive cycle. Higher-level 
      processes are performed over multiple cycles. In addition to giving a quick 
      overview of the LIDA conceptual model, and its underlying computational 
      technology, we argue for the LIDA architecture&#8217;s role as a foundational 
      architecture for an AGI. Finally, lessons For AGI researchers drawn from 
      the model and its architecture are discussed.</td>
