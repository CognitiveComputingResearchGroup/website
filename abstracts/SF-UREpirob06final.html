    <td>This position paper speaks to the interrelationships 
      between the three concepts of motivations, values, and
      emotion. Motivations prime actions, values serve to
      choose between motivations, emotions provide a
      common currency for values, and emotions implement motivations. While conceptually distinct, the three are
      so pragmatically intertwined as to differ primarily from
      our taking different points of view. To make these
      points more transparent, we briefly describe the three in
      the context a cognitive architecture, the LIDA model, for software agents and robots that models human
      cognition, including a developmental period. We also
      compare the LIDA model with other models of
      cognition, some involving learning and emotions.
      Finally, we conclude that artificial emotions will prove
      most valuable as implementers of motivations in
    situations requiring learning and development.</td>
