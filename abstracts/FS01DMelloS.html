    <td>This paper embodies the authors&#8217; suggestive, hypothetical and sometimes 
      speculative attempts to answer questions related to the interplay between 
      consciousness and AI. We explore the theoretical foundations of consciousness 
      in AI systems. We provide examples that demonstrate the potential utility 
      of incorporating functional consciousness in cognitive AI systems. We also 
      explore the possible contributions to the scientific study of consciousness 
      from insights obtained by building and experimenting with conscious AI systems. 
      Finally, we evaluate the possibility of phenomenally conscious machines.</td>
