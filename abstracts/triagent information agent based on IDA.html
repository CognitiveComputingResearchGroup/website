    <td>Busy hospital emergency rooms are concerned with shortening  the waiting times of patients, with relieving overburdened physicians, and with  reducing the number of mistakes made by triage nurses. Here we propose a  software agent, dubbed TIA (Triage Information Agent) that, via dialogue in  English, would gather both logistical and medical information from a patient  for later use by the triage nurse. TIA would also give tentative, possible  diagnoses to the triage nurse, along with recommendations for non-physician  care. The IDA Technology makes a software agent such as TIA feasible, at least  in principle. </td>
