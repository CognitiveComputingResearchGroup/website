    <td>This paper presents detailed simulation results on a modified  Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) system. We have modified Kanerva&rsquo;s original SDM  system into an architecture with a ternary memory space. This enables the  memory to be used as a Transient Episodic Memory (TEM) in cognitive software  agents. TEM is a memory with high specificity and low retention, used for  events having features of a particular time and place. Our earlier work focused  on perfunctory, proof of concept assessments on the modified SDM system. This  paper presents a detailed experimental evaluation of the modified SDM system  with regard to its ability to store and retrieve episodic information. </td>
