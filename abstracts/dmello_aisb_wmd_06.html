    <td>In this paper we attempt to develop mechanisms for procedural memory and procedural learning for cognitive robots on the basis of what is known about the same facilities in humans and animals. The learning mechanism will provide agents with the ability to learn new actions and action sequences with which to accomplish novel tasks.</td>
