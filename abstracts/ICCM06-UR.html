    <td><font SIZE="2">    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this paper we present the LIDA architecture as a     working model of cognition. We argue that such working models are broad in     scope and address real world problems in comparison to experimentally based     models which focus on specific pieces of cognition. While experimentally     based models are useful, we need a working model of cognition that     integrates what we know from neuroscience, cognitive science and AI. The     LIDA architecture provides such a working model. A LIDA based cognitive     robot or software agent will be capable of multiple learning mechanisms.     With artificial feelings and emotions as primary motivators and learning     facilitators, such systems will ‘live’ through a developmental period during     which they will learn in multiple ways to act in an effective, human-like     manner in complex, dynamic, and unpredictable environments. We discuss the     integration of the learning mechanisms into the existing IDA architecture as     a working model of cognition. </font> </td>
