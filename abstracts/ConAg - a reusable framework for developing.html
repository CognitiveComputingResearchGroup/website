    <td>ConAg is a reusable framework, written in Java, for creating conscious&quot; software agents. The system provides an application skeleton that can be customized by developers. Its particular focus is on these agents' consciousness&quot; mechanism. A conscious&quot; software agent is a cognitive agent that integrates numerous artificial intelligence mechanisms to implement the global workspace theory, a psychological theory of mind. This article gives an overview of conscious&quot; software agents and it describes the architectural style of conscious&quot; software agents, from which ConAg is constructed.</td>
