    <td>Abstract. This paper describes the integration of several cognitively inspired anticipation and anticipatory learning mechanisms in an autonomous agent architecture,
      the Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent (LIDA) system. We provide computational mechanisms for variants of payoff, state, and sensorial anticipatory
      mechanisms. The payoff anticipatory mechanism in LIDA is implicitly realized
      by the action selection dynamics of LIDA&rsquo;s decision making component. A description of a non-routine problem solving algorithm is presented as a form of state anticipatory mechanism. A technique for action driven sensational and attentional biasing is offered as a viable sensorial anticipatory mechanism. We also present an automatization mechanism and an instructionalist based procedural
    learning algorithm as forms of implicit and explicit anticipatory learning mechanisms.</td>
