    <td>Every agent aspiring to human level intelligence, every AGI agent, must 
      be capable of a theory of mind. That is, it must be able to attribute mental 
      states, including intentions, to other agents, and must use such attributions 
      in its action selection process. The LIDA conceptual and computational model 
      of cognition offers an explanation of how theory of mind is accomplished 
      in humans and some other animals, and suggests how this explanation could 
      be implemented computationally. Here we describe how the LIDA version of 
      theory of mind is accomplished, and illustrate it with an example taken 
      from an experiment with monkeys, chosen for simplicity.</td>
