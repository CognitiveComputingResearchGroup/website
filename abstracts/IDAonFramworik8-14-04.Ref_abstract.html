    <td>Crick and Koch recently introduced a Framework for Consciousness intended as a 
means of facilitating the explanation of the neural correlates of consciousness. The IDA 
model of global workspace theory is both a conceptual and computational model of consciousness, and of much of cognition as well. Here we systematically compare the ten 
aspects of the Crick and Koch Framework with hypotheses derived from the IDA model.
On the seven aspects to which the IDA model relates there&rsquo;s a surprising amount of agreement. In addition the IDA model serves to flesh out the Framework with detailed 
hypotheses about the functionality of each of the seven relevant aspects, and often of its 
structure as well. The agreement of the Framework and the IDA model would tend to 
lend support to each.<br /></td>
