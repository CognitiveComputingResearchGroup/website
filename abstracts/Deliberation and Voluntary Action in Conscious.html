    <td>Here we describe briefly the architecture and mechanisms  of a &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; software agent named IDA who is to act as a type of employment  agent. We go on to show how this architecture and these mechanisms allow IDA to  deliberate much as we humans do and to make voluntary choices of actions. The  technology described, if successful, should allow the automation of the work of  many human information agents. The IDA model also makes, hopefully testable,  hypotheses about how human deliberation and volition.</td>
