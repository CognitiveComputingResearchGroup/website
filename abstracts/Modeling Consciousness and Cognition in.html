    <td>Here we describe the  architectures of two &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; software agents and the relatively  comprehensive conceptual and computational models derived from them. Modules  for perception, working memory, associative memory, &ldquo;consciousness,&rdquo; emotions,  action selection, deliberation, and metacognition are included. The mechanisms  implementing the agents are mostly drawn from the &ldquo;new AI,&rdquo; but include both  symbolic and connectionist-like features. These models promise to yield  testable hypotheses for cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience. We also  explore briefly the relationship of these architectures to several recent  theories of cognition including embodied cognition and the dynamical systems  approach.</td>
