    <td>Software agents &ldquo;living&rdquo; and acting in a real world software  environment, such as an operating system, a network, or a database&nbsp; system, can carry out many tasks for humans.  Metacognition is very important for humans. It guides people to select,  evaluate, revise, and abandon cognitive tasks, goals, and strategies. Thus,  metacognition plays an important role in human-like software agents.  Metacognition includes metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive monitoring, and  metacognitive regulation. Conscious Mattie (CMattie), &ldquo;living&rdquo; in a Unix  machine, automatically reads and understands email concerning seminars (in  natural language), and composes and distributes weekly seminar schedule  announcements. CMattie implements Baar&rsquo;s global workspace theory of  consciousness and some other cognitive theories concerning metacognition,  episodic memory, emotions, and learning. Thus, the CMattie project has its  cognitive science side (cognitive modeling) as well as its computer science  side (intelligent software). This paper describes a case study of the design  and implementation of modeling metacognition in software agents like CMattie by  using a classifier system.</td>
