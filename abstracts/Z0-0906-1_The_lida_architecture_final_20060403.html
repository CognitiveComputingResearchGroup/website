    <td>This is a report on the LIDA architecture, a work in progress that is based on IDA, an intelligent, autonomous, &quot;conscious&quot; software agent that does personnel work for the US Navy. IDA uses locally developed cutting edge artificial intelligence technology designed to model hu-man cognition. IDA's task is to find jobs for sailors whose current assignments are about to end. She selects jobs to offer a sailor, taking into account the Navy's policies, the job&rsquo;s needs, the sailor's preferences, and her own delibera-tion about feasible dates. Then she negotiates with the sailor, in English via iterative emails, about job selection. We use the word &quot;conscious&quot; in the sense of Baars' Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1988, 1997), upon which our architecture is based.<br />
      <br />
    IDA loops through a cognitive cycle in which she perceives the environments, internal and external; creates meaning, by interpreting the environment and deciding what is important; and answers the only question there is: &quot;What do I do next?&quot; LIDA, the learning IDA will add three modes of learning to IDA's design: perceptual learn-ing, episodic learning, and procedural learning. LIDA will learn from experience, which may yield several les-sons over several cognitive cycles. Such lessons include newly perceived objects and their relationship to already known objects and categories, relationships among objects and between objects and actions, effects of actions on sen-sation, and improved perception of sensory data. The LIDA architecture incorporates six major artificial intelli-gence software technologies: the copycat architecture, sparse distributed memory, pandemonium theory, the schema mechanism, the behavior net model, and the sub-sumption architecture.</td>
