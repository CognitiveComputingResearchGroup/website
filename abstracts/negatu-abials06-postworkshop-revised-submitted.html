    <td>This paper describes the integration of several cognitively inspired anticipation 
      and anticipatory learning mechanisms in an autonomous agent architecture, 
      the Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent (LIDA) system. We provide computational 
      mechanisms and experimental simulations for variants of payoff, state, and 
      sensorial anticipatory mechanisms. The payoff anticipatory mechanism in 
      LIDA is implicitly realized by the action selection dynamics of LIDA&#8217;s 
      decision making component, and is enhanced by importance and discrimination 
      factors. A description of a non-routine problem solving algorithm is presented 
      as a form of state anticipatory mechanism. A technique for action driven 
      sensational and attentional biasing similar to a preafferent signal and 
      preparatory attention is offered as a viable sensorial anticipatory mechanism. 
      We also present an automatization mechanism coupled with an associated deautomatization 
      procedure, and an instructionalist based procedural learning algorithm as 
      forms of implicit and explicit anticipatory learning mechanisms.</td>
