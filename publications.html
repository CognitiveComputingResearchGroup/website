	 <p>Synchronous neural oscillations and cognitive processes
	 TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol.7 No.12 December 2003</p>

	 <p>The central problem for cognitive neuroscience is to describe how cognitive
	 processes arise from brain processes. This review summarizes the recent
	 evidence that synchronous neural oscillations reveal much about the origin and
	 nature of cognitive processes such as memory, attention and consciousness.
	 Memory processes are most closely related to theta and gamma rhythms, whereas
	 attention seems closely associated with alpha and gamma rhythms. Conscious
	 awareness may arise from synchronous neural oscillations occurring globally
	 throughout the brain rather than from the locally synchronous oscillations
	 that occur when a sensory area encodes a stimulus. These associations between
	 the dynamics of the brain and cognitive processes indicate progress towards a
	 unified theory of brain and cognition.</p>

	 <p>Synchronization of Neural Activity across Cortical Areas Correlates with
	 Conscious Perception</p>

	 <p>Subliminal stimuli can be deeply processed and activate similar brain areas as
	 consciously perceived stimuli. This raises the question which signatures of
	 neural activity critically differentiate conscious from unconscious
	 processing. Transient synchronization of neural activity has been proposed as
	 a neural correlate of conscious perception. Here we test this proposal by
	 comparing the electrophysiological responses related to the processing of
	 visible and invisible words in a delayed matching to sample task. Both
	 perceived and nonperceived words caused a similar increase of local (gamma)
	 oscillations in the EEG, but only perceived words induced a transient
	 long-distance synchronization of gamma oscillations across widely separated
	 regions of the brain. After this transient period of temporal coordination,
	 the electrographic signatures of conscious and unconscious processes continue
	 to diverge. Only words reported as perceived induced (1) enhanced theta
	 oscillations over frontal regions during the maintenance interval, (2) an
	 increase of the P300 component of the event- related potential, and (3) an
	 increase in power and phase synchrony of gamma oscillations before the
	 anticipated presentation of the test word. We propose that the critical
	 process mediating the access to conscious perception is the early transient
	 global increase of phase synchrony of oscillatory activity in the gamma
	 frequency range.</p>

	 <p>New vistas for alpha-frequency band oscillations
	 TRENDS in Neurosciences Vol.30 No.4</p>

	 <p>The amplitude of a&#45;frequency band (8&#45;14 Hz) activity in the human
	 electroencephalogram is suppressed by eye opening, visual stimuli and visual
	 scanning, whereas it is enhanced during internal tasks, such as mental
	 calculation and working memory. Alpha-frequency band oscillations have hence
	 been thought to reflect idling or inhibition of task-irrelevant cortical
	 areas. However, recent data on a&#45;amplitude and, in particular, alpha-phase
	 dynamics posit a direct and active role for alpha-frequency band rhythmicity
	 in the mechanisms of attention and consciousness. We propose that simultaneous
	 alpha&#45;, beta&#45; (14&#45; 30 Hz) and gamma&#45; (30&#45;70 Hz) frequency band oscillations
	 are required for unified cognitive operations, and hypothesize that
	 cross-frequency phase synchrony between alpha, beta and gamma oscillations
	 coordinates the selection and maintenance of neuronal object representations
	 during working memory, perception and consciousness.</p>

	 <p>Toward a Quantitative Description of Large Scale Neocortical Dynamic Function
	 and EEG</p>

	 <p>Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 2000</p>

	 <p>A general conceptual framework for large-scale neocortical dynamics based on
	 data from many laboratories is applied to a variety of experimental designs,
	 spatial scales and brain states, and mathematical theories, but includes
	 experimental predictions from both inside and outside EEG. Partly distinct,
	 but interacting local processes (eg, neural networks) arise from functional
	 segregation. Global processes arise from functional integration and can
	 facilitate (top down) synchronous activity in remote cell groups that function
	 simultaneously at several different spatial scales. Simultaneous local
	 processes may help drive (bottom up) macroscopic global dynamics observed with
	 EEG (or MEG).</p>

	 <p>A local/global dynamic theory is outlined that is consistent with EEG data and
	 the proposed conceptual framework. The theory is neutral on properties of
	 neural networks, embedded within macroscopic fields. Nevertheless, the purely
	 global part of the theory makes several qualitative and semi-quantitative
	 predictions of EEG measures of traveling and standing wave phenomena. A more
	 general "meta-theory" also suggests what large-scale quantitative theories of
	 neocortical dynamics may be like when more accurate treatment of local and
	 non-linear effects is achieved.</p>

	 <p>The theory describes the dynamics of fields of excitatory and inhibitory
synaptic action fields. EEG and MEG provide large-scale estimates of
	 modulation of these synaptic fields about background levels. Brain states are
	 determined by neuromodulatory control parameters. Purely local states are
	 dominated by local feedback gains and rise and decay times of post-synaptic
	 potentials. Dominant local frequencies vary with brain region. Other states
	 are purely global, with moderate to high coherence over large distances.
	 Multiple global mode frequencies are due to a combination of delays in
	 cortico-cortical axons and neocortical boundary conditions. Global frequencies
	 are identical at all cortical regions. But most states are local/global,
	 involving dynamic interactions between local networks and the global system.
	 Observed EEG frequencies may involve "matching" of local resonant frequencies
	 with one or more of the multiple, closely spaced global frequencies.</p>

	 <p>An architectural model of conscious and unconscious brain functions:
	 Global Workspace Theory and IDA.</p>

	 <p>Neural Networks, 2007</p>

	 <p>While neural net models have been developed to a high degree of
	 sophistication, they have some drawbacks at a more integrative,
	 "architectural" level of analysis. We describe a "hybrid" cognitive
	 architecture that is implementable in neuronal nets, and which has uniform
	 brain-like features, including activation-passing and highly distributed
	 "codelets", implementable as small-scale neural nets. Empirically, this
	 cognitive architecture accounts qualitatively for the data described by Baars'
	 Global Workspace Theory (GWT), and Franklin's LIDA architecture, including
	 state-of-the-art models of conscious contents in action-planning,
	 Baddeley-style Working Memory, and working models of episodic and semantic
	 longterm memory. These terms are defined both conceptually and empirically for
	 the current theoretical domain. The resulting architecture meets four
	 desirable goals for a unified theory of cognition: practical workability,
	 autonomous agency, a plausible role for conscious cognition, and
	 translatability into plausible neural terms. It also generates testable
	 predictions, both empirical and computational.</p>

	 <p>(Review) EEG alpha oscillations: The inhibition–timing hypothesis</p>

	 <p>Brain Research Reviews, June 2006</p>

	<p>The traditional belief is that the event-related alpha response can solely be described in
	terms of suppression or event-related desynchronization (ERD). Recent research, however,
	has shown that under certain conditions alpha responds reliably with an increase in
	amplitudes (event-related synchronization or ERS). ERS is elicited in situations, where
	subjects withhold or control the execution of a response and is obtained over sites that
	probably are under, or exert top-down control. Thus, we assume that alpha ERS reflects top-
	down, inhibitory control processes. This assumption leads over to the timing aspect of our
	hypothesis. By the very nature of an oscillation, rhythmic amplitude changes reflect
	rhythmic changes in excitation of a population of neurons. Thus, the time and direction of a
	change – described by phase – is functionally related to the timing of neuronal activation
	processes. A variety of findings supports this view and shows, e.g., that alpha phase
	coherence increases between task-relevant sites and that phase lag lies within a time range
	that is consistent with neuronal transmission speed. Another implication is that phase reset
	will be a powerful mechanism for the event-related timing of cortical processes. Empirical
	evidence suggests that the extent of phase locking is a functionally sensitive measure that is
	related to cognitive performance. Our general conclusion is that alpha ERS plays an active
	role for the inhibitory control and timing of cortical processing whereas ERD reflects the
	gradual release of inhibition associated with the emergence of complex spreading activation
	processes. </p>

	<p>Identifying hallmarks of consciousness in non-mammalian species.</p>

	<p>Conscious Cogn. 2005 Mar;14(1):169-87.</p>

	<p>Most early studies of consciousness have focused on human subjects. This is understandable, 
	given that humans are capable of reporting accurately the events they experience through language or by 
	way of other kinds of voluntary response. As researchers turn their attention to other animals, "accurate report" methodologies 
	become increasingly difficult to apply. Alternative strategies for amassing evidence 
	for consciousness in non-human species include searching for evolutionary homologies in anatomical substrates 
	and measurement of physiological correlates of conscious states. In addition, creative means must be 
	developed for eliciting behaviors consistent with consciousness. In this paper, we explore whether necessary 
	conditions for consciousness can be established for species as disparate as birds and cephalopods. 
	We conclude that a strong case can be made for avian species and that the case for cephalopods remains open. 
	Nonetheless, a consistent effort should yield new means for interpreting animal behavior.</p>
